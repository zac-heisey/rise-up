### COVID 19 UPDATE

RISE UP PHYSICAL THERAPY is currently open and accepting new patients! Telehealth is also available to new and existing patients.

At RISE UP Physical Therapy, we strive to protect the health and safety of our patients, staff and providers. We are enforcing social distancing whenever possible and limiting the number of patients in the clinic at one time. Some instances are impossible to avoid contact with patients and providers. We are doing everything we can to stop the spread of coronavirus (COVID -19) in all clinics. All staff members and providers are mandated to wear their PPT such as masks and gloves in the clinic. We are actively following CDC and WHO guidelines/updates. Please note that all patients in the clinic are required to wear face coverings or masks as well.

Our unique one-on-one model of treatment means that you only come in contact with your PT provider while in the clinic. We do offer telehealth visits for all patients interested to help reduce the need for in clinic exposure. We encourage telehealth especially for those who are at high risk according to the CDC or have any signs of sickness, Coronavirus related or not.

If you have any questions related to our care and clinic policies, please call the front office to speak with one of our staff: 571-655-6565

Please keep yourself informed and review the guidelines set by the CDC on their website, [cdc.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/).
