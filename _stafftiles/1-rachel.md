Rachel's passion for movement began with dance while growing up in San Diego. She knew from a young age that physical therapy was going to be her career with the combination of art and science involved. She received her Bachelor's in Kinesiology from Westmont College and went on to earn her Doctor of Physical Therapy from the University of St. Augustine.

She moved to Virginia with her husband, a Marine, and started RISE UP Physical Therapy to serve the new community she so welcome in. In her spare time she still dances, rusn obstacle course races, bakes, and enjoys the outdoors with her husband and two dogs.
