Aysha grew up in Northern Virginia playing lacrosse and attending Freedom Highschool in South Riding playing four years of Varsity. From a early age of 15 she always knew she wanted to be a Physical Therapist. She received her Bachelors in Exercise Science at Virginia Commonwealth University and went on to earn her Doctor of Physical Therapy at Murphy Deming College of Health Sciences- Mary Baldwin University.

In her free time she likes to try new foods, go hiking, grab a cup of coffee, and collect new sneakers for her collection.
