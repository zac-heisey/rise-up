Navidâ€™s passion for healthcare comes from creating opportunities for patients and providers alike. Giving patients unparalled access to services that were previously thought to be unattainable is the number one goal of his career. Giving providers opportunities and environments to hone their skills and provide the level of care they sought when they entered healthcare allows him to continue to push the envelope with new ventures. He spends his days trying to keep up with his amazing wife, his dogs, and in search of the ever elusive nap.
