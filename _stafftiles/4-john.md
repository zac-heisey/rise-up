John grew up in northern Virginia playing many sports from youth soccer to football, wrestling, and lacrosse in high school. During his undergraduate years at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, where he earned a bachelor’s in international studies, John played ultimate frisbee and eventually developed a passion for competitive road cycling that he still participates in today.

John enjoys spending time outdoors with his wife, and training with teammates and friends on the bike. As he has aspired to continue competitive cycling, John has experienced a number of injuries and set-backs over the years that have taught him a lot about his own physical and mental resilience. He graduated Marymount University’s doctor of physical therapy program, and is excited to empower individuals toward their own best quality of life, and share his enjoyment of movement with everyone.
